# Frontend Mentor E-Commerce Product Page
This project is a solution/implementation of the frontend challenge by Frontend Mentor to create an e-commerce product page.

**Challenge Link**: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ecommerce-product-page-UPsZ9MJp6

### Project Description
The site is developed using HTML, Tailwind CSS and JavaScript.

The site shows the images, price and description of a single sneaker product. The images are shown as a carousel which can be moved forward or backward using arrow keys on the left and right of the carousel. On larger screens, thumbnails of all images in the carousel appear at the bottom of the current image, to directly move to the desired image. 

A lightbox gallery can be opened by clicking any image, which shows a focused view of the product images. The lightbox gallery can only be opened on larger screens. 

The navigation bar is responsive, and changes to a sidebar on mobile devices. 

The cart is displayed as an overlay when the cart icon is clicked or tapped on the navbar. Items can be added to the cart by clicking on the *Add to Cart* button below the price of the product. 

The increment and decrement buttons can be used to change the quantity of the product. If same product is added multiple times, the current value of the item count is added to the items already in cart. 

Items can be removed by clicking or tapping on the delete (trash) icon to the right of the product in the cart. Clicking on the delete icon removes all count of the specific product.
